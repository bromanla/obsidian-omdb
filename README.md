# üé• Obsidian OMDB

## About

I‚Äôm continuing a series of small projects aimed at learning the Go language and its ecosystem.

For a long time, I‚Äôve been using Obsidian to keep personal notes. While exploring available resources, I came across a video by [FromSergio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-hKCgGhQuk), where he explains how to search and add movies from OMDb into your vault.

Although I used this solution for some time, my preference for simple, clear, and ‚Äúclean‚Äù tools turned out to be more important. That‚Äôs how the idea was born to move this functionality into a standalone service with convenient interaction through a Telegram bot.

At first glance, the solution might seem excessive, but I have two solid reasons:

1. I‚Äôm building it primarily for personal use
2. I have plans for further development of the project

For synchronization, I use Syncthing on a server that‚Äôs always online. The application is designed with this setup in mind. New movies will be added to the library and synchronized via Syncthing to all other devices.
